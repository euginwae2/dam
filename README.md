# 🛡️ DAM: Dynamic Anti-Fraud Model

DAM (Dynamic Anti-Fraud Model) is a real-time machine learning system designed to detect fraudulent transactions and flag violations of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing) regulations. Built for high-throughput financial environments, DAM leverages sequential modeling to understand user behavior over time and identify suspicious patterns with precision.

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems struggle to catch sophisticated fraud rings. DAM addresses this by learning from transactional sequences and adapting to evolving behaviors, enabling proactive fraud prevention at scale.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Sequential Modeling**: Uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture temporal patterns in user transactions.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Designed to process millions of transactions daily with sub-10ms latency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes time gaps, rolling spend windows, location shifts, and behavioral metrics.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built for deployment in high-volume environments using containerized microservices.
- **Monitoring & Auditability**: Tracks model performance and flags for compliance review.
